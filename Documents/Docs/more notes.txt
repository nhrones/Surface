Chrome-Skia

What happens inside Chrome is that Chrome generates its own representation of the 
graphical image it wants to produce (called PaintOps), and then has a specialized 
pass that walks this representation and generates a Skia program, applying some 
optimization tricks.  
 
Then, Skia itself also does optimization between its public API and its internals.    
For example, deciding whether paints with clipping are implemented as actual paints 
or via extra surfaces. (This mostly happens inside the GPU backend, which 
translates Skia API calls to GrOp types.) 

The input event hit testing and dispatching component executes hit tests to find 
out which DOM element is targeted by an event, and runs the input event dispatching 
algorithms and default behaviors.
