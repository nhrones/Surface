# CTRL
## Words
We’re used to the arrow, Backspace, and Delete keys working with a single character at a time. However, we can add the Ctrl key to have them effect entire words or paragraph at the same time.

  - Ctrl+Left Arrow – Move cursor to beginning of previous word.

  - Ctrl+Right Arrow – Move cursor to beginning of next word

  - Ctrl+Backspace – Delete previous word.

  - Ctrl+Delete – Delete next word.

  - Ctrl+Up Arrow – Move cursor to beginning of paragraph.

  - Ctrl+Down Arrow – Move cursor to end of paragraph.

## Moving the Cursor
The Ctrl key can also be combined with the Home and End keys.

  - Ctrl+Home – Move cursor to beginning of current line.
  - Ctrl+End – Move cursor to end of current line.


# Selecting Text
## Shift key
All of the above shortcuts can be combined with the Shift key to select text.

  - Shift+Left or Right Arrow Keys – Select characters one at a time.

  - Shift+Up or Down Arrow Keys – Select lines one at a time.

  - Shift+Ctrl+Left or Right Arrow Keys – Select words – keep pressing the arrow keys to select additional words.

  - Shift+Ctrl+Up or Down Arrow Keys – Select paragraphs.

  - Shift+Home – Select the text between the cursor and the beginning of the current line.

  - Shift+End – Select the text between the cursor and the end of the current line.
  
  - Shift+Ctrl+Home – Select the text between the cursor and the beginning of the text entry field.

  - Shift+Ctrl+End – Select the text between the cursor and the end of the text entry field.

  - Shift+Page Down – Select a frame of text below the cursor.

  - Shift+Page Up – Select a frame of text above the cursor.

## Ctrl key
  - Ctrl+A – Select all text.

You can use several of these shortcuts to fine-tine your selected text. For example, you could press Shift+End to select the text to the end of the current line, and then press Shift+Down to also select the line below it.

After selecting text, you can start typing immediately to replace the text – you don’t have to press Delete first.

# Editing
You can really speed up text-editing by using the Ctrl keyboard shortcuts to copy and paste text.
  - Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Insert – Copy selected text.

  - Ctrl+X, Shift+Delete – Cut selected text.

  - Ctrl+V, Shift+Insert – Paste text at cursor.

  - Ctrl+Z – Undo.

  - Ctrl+Y – Redo.
