# Surface GUI Dice Game

Yes it's my same old poker-dice game you've all seen on many platforms.    
Now, its back on my newly updated Surface framework!

## Note:
The framework and app have been bundled using my `Hot` dev-server.
I didn't minify so the bundle is readable!

Once again -- only two files -- one canvas -- fine-grained reactivity!
