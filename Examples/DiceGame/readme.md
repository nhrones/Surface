# DWM_GUI Dice Game

Yes it's my same old poker-dice game you've all seen on many platforms.    
Now, its on the desktop, not a browser, writen in pure deno typescript!

With Deno installed, run:
```
deno run -A --unstable https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhrones/DWM-GUI-New/main/Examples/DiceGame/main.ts
```
